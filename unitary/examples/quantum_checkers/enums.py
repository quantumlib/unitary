    The quantum versions differ in the way split moves work, though in all
    cases a split move is implemented by 1) first flipping a square from empty
    to X or O (depending on the player), and then 2) performing a swap operation
    between the two involved squares. In QUANTUM_V2, this is a custom swap that
    takes XE -> XE + EX (and similarly for OE), but *not* XO -> XO + OX. In
    QUANTUM_V3, this latter type of swap *is* included.
