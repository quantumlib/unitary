# Quantum cheqqers
This game is created for the master thesis by Luuk van den Nouweland, university of Leiden.
Supervisor: Evert van Nieuwenburg

# Rules
In this game, multiple rules are implemented.
1. Classical: Normal checkers
2. Superpositions: Checkers where pieces can exist in superposition
3. Simple entanglement: Checkers where pieces can be entangled with each other, but entanglement with pieces that are entangled is not possible. IS CURRENTLY BUGGED. MAY CRASH
4. Entanglement: Checkers with unlimited entanglement

# How to run
Copy this repository and run the main file: `python3 .\main.py`
Flags: If you want to play with GUI (experimental) add `--GUI=True`: `python3 .\main.py --GUI=True`

# Full implementation
For the full implementation with a Monte Carlo Tree search agent, see https://github.com/LuukvandenNouweland/quantum_checkers
