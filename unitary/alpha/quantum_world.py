    This object represents an entire state of a quantum game.
    This includes all the `QuantumObjects` as well as the effects

    criteria of measurement so that repetitions of the circuit
    will be the same even if some of the quantum objects have
    already been meaaured,

    This object also has a history so that effects can be undone.

    This object should be initialized with a sampler that determines
    how to evaluate the quantum game state. If not specified, this
    defaults to a noiseless simulator optimized for sparse state vectors.
    You may also use e.g. cirq.Simulator, a noiseless simulator using
    dense state vectors, which natively supports qudits unlike the sparse
    simulator.

    Setting the `compile_to_qubits` option results in an internal state
    representation of ancilla qubits for every qudit in the world. That
    also results in the effects being applied to the corresponding qubits
    instead of the original qudits.
